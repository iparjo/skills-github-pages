# Professional statement

## Iván P.

I've always been passionate on technology. One of my passions has always been learning, it doesn't matter which matter.
I find it one of the best ways to enjoy life in general. Sometimes I find puzzles in general a good measure to relax and do some mental training.

We live in a world where technology is getting stronger every day and improving in a lot of ways, but making us more exposed and vulnerable too.
That's made me more interested in the field of cybersecurity over the years. So I'd hope to get an entry-level cybersecurity position, to make my contribution
and be able to create a safer place on the internet. I hope having the Google Cybersecurity Certificate can make me a better candidate and allow me to get
a role on the field.

## Professional statement
My name's Iván. I'm driven and passionate about improving security, working hard to protect people from risks, vulnerabilities and threats.
